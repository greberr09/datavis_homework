    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge uses Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze statistical data about the schools in a city's school district.  The report is intended to help the school board and the mayor in making strategic decisions concerning future school budgets and priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is based on two sets of inputs, one with data for the schools themselves, including the number of students in the school, the school budget, and the school type, and one with information about each high school student in the district, including student name, ID, gender, school name, grade, and math and reading scores on standardized tests.  For this project, the raw data is stored in two csv files, \"schools_complete.csv\" and \"students_complete.csv\", in the \"Resources\" folder.  All of the outputs are interactive while running the Jupyter Notebook, and no output files are created other than in the updated Jupyter Notebook file, \"PyCitySchools.ipynb.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis proceeded by first merging the two sets of data into one combined file, and calculating various statistics to produce key metrics at the school district level.  The analysis proceeded by examining the same sets of metrics in a number of different aggregate groupings.  Aggregate metrics were created for each school; for each grade, district-wide; by the amount of spending for each school; based on the size of the school compared to other schools in the district; and based on the different school types, district_wide.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The school district metrics created included total students, total number of schools, and the overall school district budget.   The school level metrics calculated included the school's budget, the budget amount per student, the school type, the relative school size, and the relative spending category.  Each grouping, as well as at the district level, examined the average math score, the average reading score, the percentage of students who passed the math exam with a score of seventy or greater, the percentage of students who passed the reading exam with a score of seventy or more, and the overall passing rate, meaning those students who achieved at least a score of 70 on both the reading and math exams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifications (bins) for relative school size and relative school spending were provided by the school district (challenge author).  The schools were grouped into three categories of \"small\" (less than 1,000 students), \"medium\" (1,000 to 2,000 students), and \"large\" (2,000 to 5,000 students).  The spending categories of average amount spent per student were also provided.  There were five spending ranges, from under $585 up to $645-$680 per student.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This particular data set only includes high schools, which have grades 9 through 12, and it contains two school types, distric and charter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "While the data does not contain any context (which presumbably would be known to the school board and the mayor), certain trends can be derived from the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the number of high school students in the district, the number of high schools, the per student spending, the fact that there are so many charter schools relative to the total number of schools, and the really abysmal passing rates at some schools, it appears that this data represents a large urban school district.\n",
    "\n",
    "The school district has 15 highs schools that serve 39,170 students.  The annual school district budget (it is not clear but presumably only for the included schools) is $24,649,428.  Despite this relatively large budget, the average oercentae of students who are passing both math and reading is 65%, with 75%\tpassing math and 85% passing reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, according to the Public School Review, the entire district of Cleveland, for K-12, has 95 public schools serving 34,602 students.  According to the same source, the Boston Public Schools, grades K-12, have 115 schools serving 48,112 students, and the Shaker Heights Public School District has 8 schools for all grades, serving 4,684 students.  New York City Public School District reports that its public school system is far and away the largest in the United States.  It has approximately 1.1 million students who attended approximately 1,800 public schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount spent per pupil, according to this dataset, is extremely low, at no more than $680 annually.  By comparison, the ciy of Cleveland reports that it spends about $15,000 per student, and the city of Boston reports that it will spend $20,000 per pupil this year.  According to U.S. News and World Reports, Shaker Heights spends $20,596 per student per year.  New York Chalk Beat reports that New York City Public Schools will spend $38,000 per pupil in 2023-2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the district being studied, likely portions of the school population are living in poverty.  Some students may not be native English speakers or have parents who do not speak English, or have parents who must work multiple jobs and do not have time to help with homework, or have parents who themselves have little education, and are not able to provide help, do not encourge reading at home, cannot afford extracurricular activities or tutoring, and are unaware of free programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trends observed\n",
    "\n",
    "Accross all school types, students score significantly better in reading than in math.  This is entirely consistent with observed trends for schools in the United States.   Math scores in Europe and China, for example, are relatively much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "There does not seem to be a significant difference in scores per grade.  All of the scores in a particular school are relatively consistent from ninth to twelfth grade, suggesting that the school's methods or the school population are consistent.  In other large urban environments, students often score much better on standardized tests in the early grades, and their scores.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the absence of context, and some data that is not in the datasets, such as the average number of students in a classroom, it cannot be determined precisely why certain trends are apparent.  Differences could be related to student_teacher ratio, the teaching methods used, the size of the classrooms, whether the students were given yearly tests beginning in the first grade and taught to succeed on the test, or could be largely related to the socio-economic status and other characteristics of the student population over which the particular school has no control.  A school nonetheless could adopt specific approaches that have been demonstrated to succeed in other large, urban school districts where many children live below the poverty level and themselves may have to work after school.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If a large percentage of the school population is newly arrived in the United States, bilingual educatioall programs might be adopted.  For some languages, such as Spanish, there might be many existing resources in the community because of the number of bilingual speakers, and television, radio, and other media aimed at a Spanish-speaking population.  More specialized programs might be needed if a significant group of students comes from a very different cultural environment, such as fleeing war in the Sudan.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no information as to whether these standarized tests are created by the district or are mandated and standardized throughout the state, and no information about prior testing in earlier grades, which might have a large impact on test results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the school data only contains the overall number of students in a school, the metrics per grade do not show the number of students in each grade, to help determine whether students are failing the 9th grade and dropping out, or whether the class sizes remain constant.  Information about the number of students per grade per school could be derived from the available data, but was not requested for this initial study.\n",
    "\n",
    "There also is no direct information about where in the district these schools are located, and the socioeconomic status of the population of students in each school's neighborhood, including concentrations of speakers of any particular languge other than English.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Nor is there information about how students are placed in a school, such as whether some of the schools are exam schools with entrance exam requirements (such as in New York and Boston), whether some of the schools are specialized, such as for performing arts or for science (like the Bronx School of Science0, or whether studens who are struggling are sent to specific schools which have special education teachers or smaller classrooms.  Nor is there an information as to whether the charter schools accept students district-wide, if admission is by examination, lottery, or assignment by the school district, or if those are the schools which are specilized, such as intended for students interested in performing arts or in science and engineering.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There also is no information about whether some or all of the district schools, or the charter schools, follow a specific educational theory or strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If very motivated, highly-educated, and wealthy parents are choosing to send their child to charter schools, when other parents are not even aware of the existence of the charter school program, for example, that might explain some of the differences between charter and district schools as being based on things outside the school environment.  On the other hand, if the program is touted in all of the district schools as a way of getting a better education for those who cannot afford private schools, and the charter schools use demanding standards and innovative teaching techniques for all students, what the charter schools themselves are doing might explain the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the requirements did not include any aggregation by gender, school and gender, or grade and gender.  Those calculaions would be possible to produce from the data provided.  Because there are large differences in the percentages of students passing reading versus passing math, it might be informative to examine the data by these categories.  Research generally suggests, for instance, that girls who have mentors in the field, or receive early STEM training, or have science education in single-gender settings by middle school, are much more likely to be interested in a career in STEM, to believe they are equally capable as their male peers, and to score accordingly.  By contrast, girls who have teachers who believe they do not belong in STEM classes may internalize these beliefs, and come to feel that they cannot understand the work and are not skilled at it, a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take aways and next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, while the results do show some clear patterns, they are more helpful in informing the school board of actions that would not be helpful, such as throwing money at the problem, rather than in providing a clear picture of the cause of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that increasing spending at lesser-performing schools \n",
